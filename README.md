### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, this is Xiangzhi Chen.

I am currently a Ph.D. student at [Hefei University of Technology](https://www.hfut.edu.cn), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Le Wu](https://le-wu.com). My major research interest lies on Educational Data Mining, such as Cognitive Diagnosis, Knowledge Tracing and Computerized Adaptive Testing.
